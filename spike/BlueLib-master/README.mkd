Bluelib
=======

This library offers you the possibility to use the Bluetooth Low Energy in
your software. This library offers a simpler and more diversified interface
to generate request as a client Bluetooth Low Energy device than blueZ. This
doesn't replace BlueZ, but helps develop a program using Bluetooth Low
Energy as client faster.

In v2 you can have a multi-server architecture in one thread. The multi thread
requests doesn't work yet.

This library use and is based on the BlueZ library which is under the therms
of the GNU General Public License.
